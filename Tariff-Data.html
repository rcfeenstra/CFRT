          A Worldwide Tariff Database (WTD) over 1990-2010 has been prepared for
          the analysis in CFRT (2022). An earlier version of the database, WTD
          version 0 (WTD0) was used for our NBER working paper but it is not
          available in its original form. WTD version 1 (WTD1) makes extensive
          checks and improvements to WTD0, and was used to obtain the results in
          CFRT (2022).<br />
          <br />WTD1 is available in

          During the time period covered by the data, 1990-2010, a number of
          countries in eastern Europe changed their composition, so that by
          1993: Czechoslovakia split into two countries (the Czech Republic and
          Slovakia); the USSR split into 15 countries (see the list below); and
          Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia split into 5 and later 6
          countries (see the list below). The quantitative model used in CFRT
          (2022) is based on the EORA multi-region input-output table
          (https://worldmrio.com), and EORA includes the Czech Republic,
          Slovakia, the 15 countries of former USSR, and the 6 countries of
          former Yugoslavia from 1990 on. *For consistency with EORA, we have
          omitted Czechoslovakia, the USSR and Yugoslavia from the database, and
          in their place we have imputed the tariffs of the future countries
          formed from them:* specific details on how that is achieved are
          provided below.<br />

          <br />Listed in these files is the importer country code (iiso),
          exporter country code (eiso), alternative country codes from the UN or
          WITS2 (icode and ewits), SITC rev. 2, 4-digit code (sitc4), along with
          the most-favored nation (MFN) tariff t1, the preferential tariff
          between the countries, t1_pref, and – for a very small number of
          observations – a non-MFN tariff, t1_nonmfn. The main importers for
          which a non-MFN tariffs is recorded are the United States and Japan,
          and in these cases, it is only for a small number of exporting
          countries: in the United States, for example, these are the Communist
          countries for which “column 2” tariffs are used rather than the MFN
          tariff.3 Thus, in most cases the non-MFN tariff t1_nonmfn is missing.
          Importantly, for each importing country the exporters include all
          countries for which the importer has a preferential trade arrangement.
          For these exporters, the preferential tariff t1_pref and the MFN
          tariff t1 are listed; but exporting countries that have no
          preferential arrangement with the importer may or may not be listed.
          The MFN tariff for those exporting countries not listed can be
          inferred, however, from the MFN tariff listed for that importer and
          SITC goods. Specifically, if an importing country has no preferential
          agreements, then the MFN tariff schedule might be listed between that
          importing country and itself as an exporter,4 or between that
          importing country and the world (WLD) as an exporter, or between that
          importing country and specific exporting countries: so in any case,
          the MFN tariffs are provided.&nbsp;<br />
          <br />The SITC rev. 2, 4-digit classification used in this part (a)
          dataset has 784 goods. That is smaller than the 818 goods in the SITC
          rev. 2, 4-digit classification used in WTD0, an earlier version of the
          data, but a number of those 818 SITC codes ended in 0. Some of those
          codes ending in zero are not true 4-digit SITC codes, and none of them
          are used in part (a) of WTD1.<br />

          >, we list the year for which each country has a tariff schedule
          available and all the preferential trade agreements that are
          incorporated into the database. For example, Russia appears with a
          tariff schedule in 1990-1992, though that schedule is actually the
          published 1993 schedule for Russia. Estonia and Turkmenistan first
          appear with published tariff schedules in 1992, with no tariffs in
          part (a) of the database prior to that year. As explained below, we
          impute the Estonia and Turkmenistan tariffs in 1990 and 1991 by using
          the Russia tariff schedule from 1993, and the other countries of
          eastern Europe are treated in a similar way: before these regions
          exist as independent countries and publish a tariff schedule, we use
          the tariff schedule (possibly taken from the future) of another
          country.&nbsp;<br />

            >Description</span
          >&nbsp;<br />These files use the identical importer country code
          (iiso), exporter country code (eiso) and WITS codes (icode and ewits)
          that are contained in the tariff files described in part (a), and now
          country names (importer and exporter) are also introduced. There are
          slight differences, however, in the SITC 4-digit code (sitc4) and the
          tariffs as compared to part (a), and also the WTD version from which
          the tariff is drawn. Each of these items is described below.&nbsp;<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: 700">i) SITC codes and Countries</span>
          <br />The WTD0 database includes 818 SITC codes, some of which ended
          in 0, but as noted in part (a), the tariff data in WTD1 uses only 784
          codes and does not include any ending in zero. The tariff dataset in
          part (b) of the WTD1 database, includes some SITC codes ending in 0,
          in which case the tariffs are obtained from version 0 of the data,
          WTD0. In addition, there are a few importing countries whose tariffs
          are drawn from version 0 of the data. In both cases, that is indicated
          by the indicator variable version=0; otherwise, version=1.&nbsp;<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: 700">ii) MFN tariffs</span>
          <br />The most-favored nation (MFN) tariff t1 reported in this dataset
          is drawn from the dataset described in part (a). As mentioned at the
          outset of this documentation, for certain eastern European countries
          especially during 1990-1993, we created tariffs before these countries
          existed as separate entities.&nbsp;<br />
          <br />Specifically, for Russia during 1990-1992 we use the tariffs
          from the published 1993 tariff schedule, and these tariffs are
          reported for all exporters and SITC good that the USSR imported in
          each year 1990-1993. The other 14 countries of the former USSR appear
          with tariff schedules that might be earlier than 1993: Estonia and
          Turkmenistan first appear with published tariff schedules in 1992, for
          example. For the tariff database in part (b), we use the 1993 tariffs
          of Russia for these other 14 countries during 1990-1993, until these
          countries published their own schedules; and throughout 1990-1993,
          these tariffs are reported for all exporters and SITC goods that these
          countries imported in 1994.<br />
          <br />The other countries of eastern Europe are also treated in a
          similar way: before these regions exist as independent countries and
          publish their own tariff schedule, we use the tariff schedule of
          another country. Specifically, for the Czech Republic and Slovakia
          (which were formed from Czechoslovakia on January 1, 1993), their
          tariffs in 1990-1995 are taken from the 1992 Czechoslovakia tariff
          schedule, and these tariffs are reported for those exporters and SITC
          goods that Czechoslovakia imported in 1993. For Serbia during
          1990-1998 we use the tariffs from its published 2001 tariff schedule.
          For the other former Yugoslavia countries during 1990-1998, their
          tariffs are also taken from the Serbia tariff schedule of 2001 until
          they publish their own schedules.<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: 700"
            >iii) Preferential and non-MFN tariffs</span
          >
          <br />For the 15 former USSR countries that are created as distinct
          entities during 1990-1993, the preferential tariffs between them are
          set at zero until each country gains independence and publishes a
          tariff schedule, in which case tariffs might be applied against the
          other countries. Similarly, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which are
          treated as having zero tariffs against each other when they are part
          of Czechoslovakia during 1990-1992, and the countries of the former
          Yugoslavia are treated similarly.&nbsp;<br />
          <br />The non-MFN tariff, t1_nonmfn, is very similar in this dataset
          and in the dataset described in part (a), except that we cross-checked
          the non-MFN tariffs for the United States against those reported by
          the U.S. International Trade Commission, to determine the countries
          against which non-MFN tariffs are applied each year.&nbsp;<br />
          <br />Finally, in this dataset, two adjustments have been made to the
          preferential tariff between the countries as compared to part (a).
          First, we set t1_pref equal to t1 in cases where there is no
          preferential agreements between the countries.8 Second, for the very
          small number of observations where t1_nonmfn is reported (which is at
          least as large as t1) , then we set t1_pref equal to t1_nonmfn . In
          this way, a value for t1_pref is reported for every observation in the
          dataset, and t1_pref &lt; t1 for nearly all observations, with the
          exception of those cases where there is a non-MFN tariff reported, in
          which case as a matter of convention we choose to set t1_pref =
          t1_nonmfn &gt; t1. By this convention, t1_pref always reflects the
          operative tariff between countries.&nbsp;<br />
